## Job description

Tired of being a silent coder in a dark room, only receiving specs and pushing code? Do you have brilliant ideas but no one to share them with? Do you speak fluent "Customer" as well as you speak PHP or Node.js?

If you're nodding your head, we might be your new favorite team. We're looking for a Full-Stack Developer who is part coder, part detective, part translator, and part innovator. You won't just be building features; you'll be building relationships and crafting solutions.

### **Your Quest, Should You Choose to Accept It:**

- **Be the Tech Whisperer:** You'll work directly with our customers. This isn't a game of telephone; you'll listen to their needs, understand their complex business challenges, and translate them into elegant, functional solutions.
- **Architect the Awesome:** You won't just be handed a to-do list. You'll look at a problem, think outside the box (and maybe even question if the box should exist at all), and design a clear solution approach.
- **Build & Conquer:** Design, develop, and maintain robust web applications using your skills across the full stack. From a slick front-end to a powerful back-end, you'll own your creations.
- **Become a Digital MacGyver:** See a manual process? You’ll want to automate it. Face a new technology? You’ll be excited to learn it. You have a natural talent for picking up new tools and making them work for you.
- **Slay the Bugs:** Hunt down and fix issues with the tenacity of a seasoned detective. You see a bug not as a failure, but as a puzzle waiting to be solved.
- **Share the Wisdom:** Participate in code reviews, share your brilliant ideas, and help us all get better. We believe in "strong opinions, weakly held.

## Your skills and experience

- **Core Skills:** A minimum of 3 years of experience as a software developer, with solid proficiency in **PHP** or **Node.js**.
- **Communication Champion:** Your English communication skills are excellent. You can explain a complex API integration to a non-technical client without making their eyes glaze over. This is non-negotiable!
- **JavaScript Wizardry:** Strong knowledge of JavaScript is essential. Bonus points if you've danced with **ReactJS**.
- **Tech Chameleon:** You adapt quickly. Docker, Git, and CI/CD are your natural habitat. New technologies don't scare you; they excite you.
- **The Automator:** You’ve played with automation tools like Zapier, N8N, Pipedream, or Make because you’d rather build a robot to do the work twice.
- **API & Data Guru:** You have a solid grasp of RESTful API design, HTTP protocols, and can design efficient queries for both SQL and NoSQL systems.
- **Bonus Points:** Experience with HubSpot or other CRM systems is a fantastic plus!
