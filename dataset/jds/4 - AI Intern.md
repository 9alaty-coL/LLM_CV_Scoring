**About Skyclad Ventures**

Skyclad Ventures is an engineering-led startup builder, working at the intersection of AI, IoT, mobility, and intelligent systems. We partner with exceptional founders and teams to take ideas from zero to one, building both software and hardware solutions that solve real-world problems. Our projects span AI-powered mobility, document intelligence, property tech, and computer vision, with a focus on taking bold, moonshot ideas to market fast.  
  
We operate like a high-speed startup lab – small teams, big impact, and rapid iteration cycles. If you want to work on challenging problems, ship products fast, and learn directly from founders and senior engineers who’ve built and scaled global products, you’ll feel at home here.  

**What You’ll Work On**

- Build and fine-tune AI models for computer vision, speech recognition, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
- Implement and integrate YOLO-based object detection pipelines for real-time use cases.
- Work on data labeling using Roboflow or similar annotation tools to create high-quality datasets.
- Experiment with and deploy speech-to-text or related audio processing models.
- Assist in developing RAG-based systems for intelligent document search and conversational AI.
- Collaborate with full-stack engineers to integrate AI models into MERN stack applications.
- Research, prototype, and optimize AI pipelines for performance, scalability, and accuracy.  
      

**What We’re Looking For**
- Strong Python programming skills.
- Experience working with MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).
- Hands-on experience with YOLO object detection models.
- Familiarity with data labeling tools like Roboflow or equivalent.
- Knowledge of speech-to-text models (e.g., Whisper, Google STT, or similar).
- Exposure to RAG pipelines using vector databases and LLMs.
- Ability to work in a startup-style environment: proactive, fast learner, and adaptable.  
**Nice to Have**
- Experience with vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate, FAISS).
- Familiarity with LangChain or similar frameworks.
- Knowledge of cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure) for AI deployment.
- Previous AI/ML hackathon or startup project experience.  
**Why Join Us?**
- Work directly with founders and senior engineers on cutting-edge AI projects.
- Get exposure to real product development, from ideation to deployment.
- Flexible work culture and high ownership of projects.
- Opportunity for a post-placement offer based on performance – grow with us as we scale.
